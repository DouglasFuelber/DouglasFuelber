ðŸ’» Passionate about programming, I am always looking to learn new technologies, methodologies, programming languages or any knowledge that adds to my growth.

ðŸš€ As a software developer, I like to work on different types of projects, especially web applications, which challenge me technically and allow me to work with teams composed by people of different profiles, which allows a great exchange of knowledge and adds a lot to my professional and personal growth.
